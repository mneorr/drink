## Super awesome drinking game
It's so special because it plays by itself.
You can keep playing Monopolyâ„¢ or continue your conversations,
while the game decides who needs to drink.

## Dude, how do I run this?
1. Set your terminal font size to MAX, and open the laptop on a visible spot.
2. `$ ruby drink.rb`

## Acknowledgements
This game was made in roughly 15 seconds during some of the @NSSpain's
drinking sessions. We couldn't decide which drinking game is international enough,
and this one just pushed the limits further. Yeah, I know.
